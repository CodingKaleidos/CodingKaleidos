Hi, I'm Sophia — professional developer, security tinkerer, and chaos-forged problem solver.
When I'm not rewriting things that already work (badly) for **absolutely no visual gain**, I'm building tools that *don’t suck* and testing systems until they cry.

> No, I *still* can't design a UI that doesn’t look like 2003 threw up.

### 💻 What I Work With (a lot)
- **C# / .NET** – Blazor, MAUI, ASP.NET, Entity Framework
- **C++ / C** – low-level spells and performance rituals
- **JavaScript** – with too many frameworks, yes
- **HTML / CSS** – and I *will* style that div poorly!
- **TYPO3 Extensions** – surprisingly fun, surprisingly cursed
- **PHP** – legacy lives here
- **Security Testing** – break first, patch later
- **Cross-platform App & Web App Development** – one codebase to rule them all

### 👻 Why There's Nothing Here
Most of my projects are **private**, **client-owned**, or **too experimental** to unleash upon the world. But trust me — they exist. Somewhere.

### 🛠️ Favorite Tools
- Visual Studio / Code
- Linux (Mint Cinnamon gang)
- Git & GitHub
- Docker
- Postman, Swagger, Wireshark
- Coffee
- Not Ai
